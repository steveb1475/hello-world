# hello-world

Hey all

I'm Steve, I program PLC's -industrial machines and processes.  I dink around with computers in my spare time. I'm spending more and more time in Linux and this has led me to github. I use another revision managment software from Rockwell in my professional work and I'm interested in exploring github's features. 

My hobbies include fixing cars, home improvement projects, carpentry, machining, electronics, 3d printing, camping, backpacking, climbing, motorcycles - dirtbikes and the list goes on and on.
